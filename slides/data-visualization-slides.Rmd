## Grammar of Graphics

<!-- class: middle -->

<!-- <p style="font-size: 150%";> -->
<!-- The grammar of graphics is based on the insight that you can uniquely describe <i>any</i> plot as a combination of a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment, a coordinate system, and a faceting scheme. -->
<!-- </p> -->

*Note: `ggplot` uses the + where `tidyverse` uses the pipe. Make sure you don't flip the two.*
