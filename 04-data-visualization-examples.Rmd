```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


# Load Packages

Let's load the packages we need. These include `tidyverse` (especially the `dplyr` package) and `janitor`. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

# Import NHANES Data

Let's import our data using `read_csv`. 

```{r}
nhanes <- read_csv("data/nhanes.csv") 
```

# ggplot template

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = data_frame,
       mapping = aes(x = x_variable,
                     y = y_variable)) +
  geom_something()
```



# Scatterplot

We use `geom_point` to make a scatterplot. Let's make a scatterplot that shows age on the x axis and height on the y axis.

```{r}

```

Let's take a look at what's going on here.

# Histogram 

We use `geom_histogram` to make a histogram. Let's make a histogram of height.

```{r}

```


How does ggplot know what to plot on the y axis? It's using the default statistical transformation for `geom_histogram`, which is `stat = "bin"`.


![](slides/images/grammar-of-graphics-stat-example-bin.png)

If we add `stat = "bin"` we get the same thing. Each geom has a default stat.

```{r}

```

We can adjust the number of bins using the `bins` argument. 

```{r}

```


# Bar Chart

There are two basic approaches to making bar charts, both of which use `geom_bar`.

**Approach #1**

Use your full dataset.

Only assign a variable to the x axis.

Let ggplot use the default `stat` transformation (`stat = "count"`) to generate counts that it then plots on the y axis.

**Approach #2**

Wrangle your data frame before plotting, possibly creating a new data frame in the process

Assign variables to the x and y axes

Use `stat = "identity"` to tell ggplot to use the data exactly as it is


## Bar Chart v1

Let's make a bar chart that shows height.


```{r}

```


The default statistical transformation for `geom_bar` is `count`. This will give us the same result as our previous plot.

```{r}

```

Here's what's going on.

![](slides/images/grammar-of-graphics-stat-example.png)


## Bar Chart v2

It's often easier to do our analysis work, save a data frame, and then use this to plot.

Let's recreate our `female_height_inches_by_age` data frame. Note that I am using the `drop_na` function to, well, drop NA values.

```{r}
female_height_inches_by_age <- nhanes %>% 
  filter(gender == "female") %>% 
  mutate(height_inches = height / 2.54) %>% 
  group_by(age_decade) %>% 
  summarize(height_inches = mean(height_inches,
                                 na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  drop_na(age_decade)
```



Then let's use this data frame to make a bar chart. The `stat = "identity"` here tells ggplot to use the exact data points without any `stat` transformations.

```{r}

```


# `color` and `fill`

## color

We add the color argument *within* the `aes` so that the data in that variable is mapped to those aesthetic properties. Let's add different colors for males and males to our previous scatterplot.

```{r}

```

Note that each option in the gender variable (male and female) is mapped to a color (male = teal, female = red).

![](slides/images//grammar-of-graphics-color-mapping-example.png)

Let's try the same thing with our last bar chart. 

```{r}

```

That didn't work! Let's try `fill` instead.

```{r}

```


# Scales

![](slides/images/grammar-of-graphics.png)

## color

We can change which colors the data is mapped to by using a `scale_` function. Let's change the colors from our scatterplot to use a built-in palette like `scale_color_viridis_d` (the d means it's for discrete data). 

FYI: The viridis scales provide colour maps that are perceptually uniform in both colour and black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness.

```{r}

```



# Plot Labels

To add labels to our plot, we use `labs`. We can a title to the plot with the `title` argument. Let's take our last scatterplot and add a title. 

```{r}

```

We can add a `subtitle` as well.

```{r}

```


We can change the x and y axis labels using the `x` and `y` arguments.

```{r}

```

To change the title above the legend, we use the name of the aesthetic that is being shown.

```{r}

```

# Themes

To add a theme to a plot, we use the `theme_` set of functions. There are several built-in themes. For instance, `theme_minimal`.

```{r}

```

There are also packages that give you themes you can apply to your plots. 

Let's load the `ggthemes` package (I installed it for you).

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
```

We can then use a theme from this package (`theme_economist`) to make our plots look like those in the Economist.

```{r}

```




# Facets

One of the most powerful features of ggplot is facetting. You can make small multiples by adding just a line of code using the `facet_wrap` function. Let's make two separate scatterplots from our example above (one for males, one for females).

```{r}

```



We can do this for any type of figure. Recall our histogram from before (with a nice theme added).


```{r}

```

You can use `facet_wrap` for as many groups as you have in your data. For example, let's make the same scatterplot as above, but for education level.

```{r}

```

# Save Plots

There are two ways to think about saving your plots. 

If you're working in RMarkdown, just knit your file and your plots will show up as part of your HTML, Word, or PDF document. Use this option by default!

If you do need to save an individual plot for some other purpose (e.g. putting it in a report not created in RMarkdown), use the `ggsave` function. By default, `ggsave` will save the last plot you made.

First, we plot.

```{r}

```

And then we save this plot.

```{r}

```

We can save our plot to other formats as well. PDF is a great option because it produces small file sizes and high-quality plots. You don't need to list dpi here as PDFs are [vector based](https://www.stickermule.com/blog/raster-vs-vector-images).

```{r}

```
